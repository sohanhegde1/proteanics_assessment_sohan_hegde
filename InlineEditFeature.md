## Introduction
This document outlines the design for an AI-enabled inline edit feature for Tiptap editor that allows users to select content, provide modification instructions, and receive AI-generated suggestions they can accept or reject.

## Feature Overview
- Users highlight text and trigger feature via keyboard shortcut (⌘+E / Ctrl+E)
- A lightweight interface appears for submitting modification instructions
- Selected content and instructions are sent to an LLM for processing
- Suggested modifications are presented in a clear diff view
- Users can accept/reject changes or revise instructions
- The feature ensures compatibility with all editor components, including custom nodes

## Technical Architecture

### Key Components
1. **AIEditExtension**: Custom Tiptap extension managing the AI editing feature
2. **SelectionManager**: Handles text selection and context capture
3. **AIEditInterface**: UI component for instruction input and diff display
4. **DiffCalculator**: Generates visual diffs between original and suggested text
5. **LLMConnector**: Service for communicating with the LLM API

## User Experience Flow
1. User selects text in editor
2. User presses keyboard shortcut (⌘+E / Ctrl+E)
3. Popup appears for entering modification instructions
4. System sends text and instructions to LLM (showing loading indicator)
5. System displays suggested modifications in diff view
   - Original text with strikethrough for deleted content
   - New text with highlight for added content
6. User decides to:
   - Accept changes (Enter key)
   - Reject changes (Escape key)
   - Edit instructions (Up arrow key)
7. If accepted, changes are applied to the document
8. Editor focus is restored to the end of the modified content

## Implementation Details

### Core Functions
- **captureSelection**: Captures selected content and surrounding context
- **processWithLLM**: Sends content to LLM with instructions and processes response
- **calculateDiff**: Generates visual representation of changes
- **applyChanges**: Integrates modifications back into document structure
- **createDiffDecorations**: Handles visual highlighting of changes

### Keyboard Interaction
```typescript
addKeyboardShortcuts() {
  return {
    [this.options.shortcut]: () => this.editor.commands.triggerAIEdit(),
    'Enter': () => {
      if (this.isAIEditActive()) {
        this.applyChanges(this.editor.view)
        return true
      }
      return false
    },
    'Escape': () => {
      if (this.isAIEditActive()) {
        this.rejectChanges(this.editor.view)
        return true
      }
      return false
    },
    'ArrowUp': () => {
      if (this.isAIEditActive() && this.currentEdit.diff) {
        this.editInstructions()
        return true
      }
      return false
    }
  }
}
```

## Edge Cases and Considerations

### 1. Complex Document Structures
**Challenge**: AI modifications might break complex structures (tables, lists, custom nodes)
**Solution**: Implement structure-aware parsing and validate against schema

### 2. Nested and Overlapping Selections
**Challenge**: Selections spanning multiple nodes or partially within complex nodes
**Solution**: Smart selection expansion to include complete nodes

### 3. Managing LLM Context Window
**Challenge**: Selected content exceeding LLM context window
**Solution**: Smart truncation strategies preserving essential context

### 4. Handling LLM Failures
**Challenge**: Failed requests, timeouts, or invalid results
**Solution**: Robust error handling with retry mechanisms

### 5. Preserving Editor History
**Challenge**: Integrating AI edits with editor's undo/redo history
**Solution**: Wrap edits in ProseMirror steps with metadata

### 6. Multiple Simultaneous Edits
**Challenge**: Users triggering multiple edits before completion
**Solution**: Queue system with visual indication of progress

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual components and algorithms
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and state management
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user flow and complex structures
4. **LLM Response Mocking**: Varied scenarios including failures

## Future Enhancements
1. Contextual suggestions without explicit instructions
2. Smart presets for common editing tasks
3. Interactive editing of AI suggestions
4. Style consistency analysis
5. Collaborative editing integration

## Conclusion
This feature will significantly enhance the editing experience by seamlessly integrating LLM capabilities within Tiptap. The implementation addresses the complexities of ProseMirror's document model while ensuring compatibility with custom extensions. By handling edge cases around document structures, nested selections, and error handling, we'll deliver an intuitive user experience that augments rather than replaces user input.
